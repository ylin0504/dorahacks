# **Who uses [Dorahacks.io](https://dorahacks.io/)?**

## **Builders/Hackers**

The core mission of [DoraHacks](https://dorahacks.io/) is to support the global hacker movement. Hackers are developers and builders (aka ‘BUIDLers’) who work autonomously on projects that make up the next generation of applications and tools in the global digital ecosystem. Every game-changing startup began as a fledgling project; DoraHacks exists to empower these very early stage teams to grow, secure funding, and take their projects to the next level. Builders can list their project on DoraHacks as a BUIDL, take part in hackathons, apply for grants, complete bounties, and secure investment to continue building.
