BUIDLs are projects listed on the DoraHacks platform. They can be entered individually into the BUIDLs page, or submitted as part of a hackathon.

Builders list their projects to exhibit them to a wide audience, and demonstrate the capabilities and potential of their work.

BUIDLs on DoraHacks can include the following information:

- **Project introduction and mission statement:** Advertise the key features and goals of your project to potential partners and investors
- **Past milestones:** Highlight past achievements, from concept origination to key development progress
- **Future roadmap:** Illustrate what the next steps look like, and when your project will be seeking collaboration and investment
- **Demo video:** A key tool to demonstrate the current state of your project and its UI
- **External links:** Link to more detailed documents and pages such as a website, whitepaper, and social media accounts
- **Team information:** Let potential partners and investors know who is behind your project
- **Direct messaging:** Interested parties can contact BUIDL owners directly on the DoraHacks platform, no need to share personal contact information

Potential partners and investors browse the BUIDLs page looking for promising projects to partner with and invest in. To date, BUIDLs listed on DoraHacks have received over $30 million in funding, with even more contributed through community support.
