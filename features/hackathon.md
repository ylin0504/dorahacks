# **Hackathon**

🔑 Hackathon page: [https://dorahacks.io/hackathon](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon)

A hackathon is an event in which an organizer sets out the details of a problem that they need solved, and developers come together in teams to submit their solutions in the hope of winning prizes.

Commonly seen hackathon organizers are Web3 ecosystems, student societies, and other frontier tech related communities, but hackathons are a useful tool for a range of other projects and organizations.

**The benefits for organizers include:**

- Access to a large global network of developers and technologists
- Convenient, outsourced problem-solving and ecosystem growth
- Marketing and brand promotion opportunities

**Benefits for participants include:**

- A chance to demonstrate their technological and creative abilities
- Networking opportunities and career progression
- Financial rewards from generous prize pools
