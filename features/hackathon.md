# **Hackathon**

🔑 Hackathon page: [https://dorahacks.io/hackathon](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon)

A hackathon is an event in which an organizer sets out the details of a problem that they need solved, and developers come together in teams to submit their solutions in the hope of winning prizes.

Commonly seen hackathon organizers are Web3 ecosystems, student societies, and other frontier tech related communities, but hackathons are a useful tool for a range of other projects and organizations.

**The benefits for organizers include:**

- Access to a large global network of developers and technologists
- Convenient, outsourced problem-solving and ecosystem growth
- Marketing and brand promotion opportunities

**Benefits for participants include:**

- A chance to demonstrate their technological and creative abilities
- Networking opportunities and career progression
- Financial rewards from generous prize pools
- The potential to have their submissions chosen for further investment

Hackathons supported by DoraHacks can take place in person (offline) as well as virtually (online) in order to maximize accessibility.

DoraHacks provides a bespoke platform for organizers to run their hackathons, **key features include:**

- **Backend Judging Infrastructure** to facilitate winners selection
- **Free Editing** to customize the hackathon page’s content
- **Private Hackathons** to password-protect visibility and participation
- **Hackathon Bounties** to specify goals of submitted projects
- **Customisable Tracks** to separate submissions into categories
- **Discussion Forums** to share knowledge and advice
- **Multiple Admins to delegate management of hackathons**
- **BUIDL Approval to allow organizers to prevent unsuitable BUIDLs from being included**
