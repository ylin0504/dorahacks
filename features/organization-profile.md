# **Organization Profile**

Every organization who uses DoraHacks is required to set up an organization page in order to create hackathons and grants. This page contains:

- Organization Introduction to provide background information
- Members List to show who is on the team. Members do not have management access for editing the organization page or creating hackathons etc, but can be upgraded to Admins if this is required

**Activity History**

to log the hackathons and bounties previously created by the organization
