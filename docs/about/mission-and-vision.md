# Mission and Vision

## Mission

DoraHacks is on a mission to connect builders, capital, and ecosystems so that important technologies and public goods can be created faster and adopted by the world.

The platform helps developers around the globe:

- Find like minded teammates  
- Validate ideas through hackathons and grants  
- Access long term funding and ecosystem support  

## Vision

DoraHacks aims to be the infrastructure layer for global hacker movements and developer ecosystems.

The long term vision includes:

- A network of hackathons, grants, and programs that keep builders engaged  
- Permissionless tools that any ecosystem can use to support developers  
- Transparent and efficient mechanisms for funding public goods and open source projects  

By lowering the barrier for both builders and organizers, DoraHacks hopes to make it easier for impactful technologies to emerge and grow.
