# Why DoraHacks?

DoraHacks focuses on long term support for builders, not only one time events.

## Global Hacker Movement

DoraHacks has organized and supported hackathons and grant programs with ecosystems around the world. Builders can bring the same BUIDL to different events and keep growing it instead of starting from zero each time.

## Infrastructure for Funding

Through Dora Factory and related tooling, DoraHacks supports:

- Quadratic funding rounds  
- MACI and other privacy preserving mechanisms  
- On chain distribution and transparent records  

This helps ecosystems deploy funding fairly and efficiently.

## Tools for Builders and Organizers

The platform includes:

- BUIDL pages for projects  
- Hacker and organization profiles  
- Hackathon and grant round management consoles  
- AI based tools that assist reviewing, judging, and post event follow up  

## Focus on Long Term BUIDLs

DoraHacks encourages builders to:

- Keep updating the same BUIDL  
- Build relationships with ecosystems  
- Turn hackathon prototypes into real products and public goods  

This long term view is one of the main reasons ecosystems choose DoraHacks.
